- Overall review: ZiZi offers a Mediterranean-inspired menu that feels both inventive and comforting. The Crazy Baba was an innovative version of babaghanoush with its smooth, smoky flavors and unique ingredients like basil and feta. The grilled oyster mushroom sandwich was unlike anything I've tried before—earthy and satisfying, with the mushrooms cooked to perfection. The za'atar fingerling potatoes were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with the za'atar adding a fragrant, herby touch. The ambiance is modern and chic, making it a perfect spot for a leisurely meal in the city. Every dish felt well-executed and thoughtfully put together.

- Overall review: Goldie was a total win—everything I tried was fresh, flavorful, and incredibly satisfying. The falafel wrap was a standout, with melt-in-mouth falafel and fresh, bright toppings that all came together in the best way. The shawarma fries were another highlight—crispy, well-seasoned, and full of bold flavors. But the Turkish coffee tehina shake was the real surprise.

It was definitely one of the most enjoyable, casual meals I’ve had in a while.
