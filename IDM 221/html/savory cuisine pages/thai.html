                Overall review: Chatayee was one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to. The Tom Kha soup was a standout, with its creamy coconut base, perfectly balanced by tangy lime and just the right amount of spice. It was rich but light at the same time, making it super comforting. The mango sticky rice was another highlight—fresh, sweet mango paired with warm, perfectly cooked sticky rice and a drizzle of coconut milk. It was such a simple yet satisfying way to end the meal. Everything felt authentic and thoughtfully prepared, and the atmosphere was laid-back and welcoming. Definitely a spot I'll be returning to.

                Overall review: Grandma's Philly is a great spot for a casual, flavorful meal. The tofu satay skewers were the highlight for me—perfectly grilled with a nice smoky flavor, paired with a rich, creamy peanut sauce that made each bite really satisfying. The menu had a lot of variety, and everything felt fresh, though some dishes didn't stand out as much as the skewers. The casual, homey atmosphere was nice and added to the experience. Overall, it's a solid option for a relaxed meal with some standout flavors, especially if you're into plant-based options.
