            <h2>GupShup</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Location: NYC</li>
                <li>Rating: 5/5</li>
                <li>Favorite Dishes: Garlic naan, black daal, paneer butter masala, and onion chili cheese kulcha</li>

                Overall review: GupShup was hands-down the most fun I've had eating Indian food in a restaurant‚Äîeverything was unique, 
                flavorful, and fantastic. The appetizers were a total highlight, especially the crispy okra with guacamole, which was 
                crunchy, fresh, and perfectly spiced. The paneer cheese rolls were another win, with the mint-coriander pesto and mango 
                combo being an unexpected but genius pairing. The naan was super fluffy and soft, with just the right hint of garlic, 
                while the daal was creamy, filling, and probably the best I've ever had. The paneer had a unique flavor compared to what 
                I've tasted before, and I really enjoyed it. The onion chili cheese kulcha was melt-in-your-mouth amazing and such a fun 
                dish to eat.

                Overall review: Patiala Indian Grill offers an unforgettable experience with Indian cuisine that's both comforting and exciting. 
                The aloo tikki chaat set the tone with its perfect balance of textures‚Äîcrispy on the outside, soft and spiced inside, and topped 
                with tangy chutneys. The palak patta chaat was another standout, with the crunchy spinach leaves covered in yogurt and chutneys 
                creating an explosion of flavor in every bite. The garlic naan was warm, fluffy, and fragrant, ideal for soaking up the rich, velvety 
                malai kofta. Each dish was vibrant and packed with flavor, making for an incredible meal from start to finish. The ambiance was also 
                really nice with the decor and furniture - this dining experience was truly luxurious.

            <ul>
                <li>Location: NJ</li>
                <li>Rating: 5/5</li>
                <li>Favorite Dishes: Avocado sev chaat, palak chaat</li>
            </ul>
            <!--insert images-->
            <p>
                Overall review: Haldi delivered an exceptional dining experience with every dish bursting with fresh and bold flavors. The avocado 
                sev chaat was a delightful mix of creamy avocado, crunchy sev, and tangy chutneys, making each bite a delicious contrast of textures. 
                The palak chaat was equally impressive, with crispy spinach leaves smothered in sweet and spicy sauces that made the dish both light 
                and satisfying. Every bite felt vibrant and full of life, leaving a lasting impression and a craving to return for more. I also really 
                liked how friendly the staff were and the presentation of the food was very creative.

            <h2>Mod India</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Location: Glen Mills, PA</li>
                <li>Rating: 4/5</li>
                <li>Favorite Dishes: Tangi Eggplant</li>
            </ul>
            <!--insert images-->
            <p>
                Overall review: Mod India delivers high-quality, flavorful dishes that shine when enjoyed in the restaurant. The Tangi Eggplant 
                stood out with its bold spices and perfectly cooked texture, offering a comforting and slightly tangy flavor that lingers. The 
                restaurant strikes a balance between casual and upscale, making it a great choice for a relaxed yet refined dining experience. 
                However, the food doesn't translate as well to takeout, so it's best savored fresh from the kitchen. If you're after a unique 
                Indian meal with a variety of flavors, this spot is worth a visit.

                Overall review: Snowman Sandwiches is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic Indian sandwiches that are both comforting and 
                delicious. The Bombay Sandwich is the star of the menu, with its incredibly soft bread, classic melty cheese, and flavorful 
                chutneys that perfectly enhance the fresh veggies. The three-tier sandwich is generously portioned, and the price is unbeatable 
                for the quality. Each bite feels like a warm hug, making it an essential stop if you're in India. These sandwiches are ridiculously 
                good‚Äîyou'll be hooked after just one!

                Overall review: Sankalp has always been a go-to spot for me, and it's easy to see why. The paper dosa is perfectly crispy, 
                delivering that satisfying crunch every time. Their chutneys are packed with flavor, offering just the right balance to the dosa. 
                And the lassis? They're the perfect combination of creamy and sweet, a must-order with every meal. Growing up, I visited Sankalp often, 
                and it has stayed a comfort spot for me. Even after all these years, it continues to shine with the same quality and warmth that make it 
                feel timeless.
