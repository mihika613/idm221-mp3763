                Indian food has always held a special place in my heart, not just because of my heritage but because 
                of the incredible depth and diversity of flavors. The vibrant spices, rich aromas, and comforting familiarity

            <h2>Mediterranean</h2>

            <p>
                Mediterranean food is wholesome, healthy, and very fresh. The way it balances vibrant flavors with simplicity is the trait 
                which makes it stand out. From creamy hummus to crisp, herb-filled salads and perfectly seasoned grilled vegetables, Mediterranean 
                cuisine always feels light, nourishing, and full of life.

            <h2>Italian</h2>
            <h3>favorite food: ravioli</h3>
            <p>
                Italian food is so fulfilling, and I admire the variety of textures in each meal. The crispiness of the bread, the creaminess of the sauce, 
                the tanginess of the tomatoes, and the freshness of the basil all come together to form the most enlightening taste.
