                Overall review: Dominique Ansel Bakery is a must-visit destination for anyone with a sweet tooth, and the Cookie Shot is an absolute showstopper. This creative treat features a warm, chocolate chip cookie shaped like a shot glass, perfectly crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside, served with cold vanilla milk inside the cookie. This was so fun to drink/eat, and the sweetness wasn't overpowering - rather the perfect amount. The atmosphere of the bakery is charming and inviting, making it a great spot to indulge in a delicious dessert or pastry. With a commitment to innovation and quality, Dominique Ansel Bakery delivers an unforgettable experience that keeps you coming back for more. If you're in NYC, don't miss out on this delightful gem!

                Overall review: Maman's is a delightful bakery that captures the essence of a cozy French caf√© in the heart of NYC. The vanilla mango croissant is a must-try‚Äîflaky and buttery on the outside, with a luscious filling that perfectly balances the sweetness of vanilla and the tropical tang of mango. Each bite is a heavenly experience that transports you to a Parisian patisserie. The warm, inviting atmosphere makes it an ideal spot to relax with a coffee or grab a pastry on the go. With its attention to quality and charming vibe, Maman's is a true gem that you won't want to miss!
