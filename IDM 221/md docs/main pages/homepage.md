Hi, I’m Mihika - welcome to my restaurant blog! I’m a 19-year-old college student and vegetarian based in Philadelphia with a deep passion for exploring food beyond the usual spots. Whether it's a cozy café tucked away in the corner of the city or a hole-in-the-wall restaurant serving authentic, mouth-watering dishes, I’m all about finding those hidden gems that deserve a spotlight. For me, food is more than just a meal—it's an experience, a journey of flavors that I can’t wait to share with you.

As someone who loves to push the boundaries of my palette—while staying true to my vegetarian lifestyle—I’m always on the lookout for new tastes, textures, and culinary styles. This restaurant blog is a space where I document my adventures in food, from street-side vendors to fine dining experiences, all with the goal of uncovering places that have the best plant-based meals. Join me as I explore and review restaurants, sharing my honest thoughts, recommendations, and foodie finds that you won’t want to miss.

Whether you’re a fellow food lover, a curious traveler, or just someone looking for their next great meal, I hope my blog inspires you to step outside your comfort zone and discover your own hidden gems!
