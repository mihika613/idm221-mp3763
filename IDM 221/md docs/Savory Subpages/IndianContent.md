## GupShup

- Location: NYC
- Rating: 5/5
- Favorite Dishes: Garlic naan, black daal, paneer butter masala, and onion chili cheese kulcha
- Overall review: GupShup was hands-down the most fun I’ve had eating Indian food in a restaurant—everything was unique, flavorful, and fantastic. The appetizers were a total highlight, especially the crispy okra with guacamole, which was crunchy, fresh, and perfectly spiced. The paneer cheese rolls were another win, with the mint-coriander pesto and mango combo being an unexpected but genius pairing. The naan was super fluffy and soft, with just the right hint of garlic, while the daal was creamy, filling, and probably the best I’ve ever had. The paneer had a unique flavor compared to what I’ve tasted before, and I really enjoyed it. The onion chili cheese kulcha was melt-in-your-mouth amazing and such a fun dish to eat.

## Mod India

- Location: Glen Mills, PA
- Rating: 4/5
- Favorite Dishes: Tangi Eggplant
- Overall review: Mod India delivers high-quality, flavorful dishes that shine when enjoyed in the restaurant. The Tangi Eggplant stood out with its bold spices and perfectly cooked texture, offering a comforting and slightly tangy flavor that lingers. The restaurant strikes a balance between casual and upscale, making it a great choice for a relaxed yet refined dining experience. However, the food doesn't translate as well to takeout, so it's best savored fresh from the kitchen. If you’re after a unique Indian meal with a variety of flavors, this spot is worth a visit.
