            <p>
                Overall review: ZiZi offers a Mediterranean-inspired menu that feels both inventive and comforting. 
                The Crazy Baba was an innovative version of babaghanoush with its smooth, smoky flavors and unique 
                ingredients like basil and feta. The grilled oyster mushroom sandwich was unlike anything I've tried 
                before‚Äîearthy and satisfying, with the mushrooms cooked to perfection. The za'atar fingerling potatoes 
                were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with the za'atar adding a fragrant, herby touch. 
                The ambiance is modern and chic, making it a perfect spot for a leisurely meal in the city. Every dish 
                felt well-executed and thoughtfully put together.

            <h2>Goldie</h2>

            <img alt="a pic of goldie" src="../../images/goldie1.jpg" width="275" />
            <p>
                Overall review: Goldie was a total win‚Äîeverything I tried was fresh, flavorful, and incredibly satisfying. 
                The falafel wrap was a standout, with melt-in-mouth falafel and fresh, bright toppings that all came together 
                in the best way. The shawarma fries were another highlight‚Äîcrispy, well-seasoned, and full of bold flavors. But 
                the Turkish coffee tehina shake was the real surprise. It was rich, creamy, and had just the right hint of coffee 
                that made it super memorable. The mix of flavors throughout the meal was spot on, and everything felt so well-prepared. 
                It was definitely one of the most enjoyable, casual meals I've had in a while.

                <li>Favorite Dishes: Salatim, shawarma-spiced cauliflower, brown sugar-vanilla soft serve with blueberry compote</li>

            <img alt="a pic of laser wolf" src="../../images/laserwolf2.jpg" width="275" />
            <p>
                Overall review: Laser Wolf delivers a memorable dining experience with its fresh, flavorful take on Middle Eastern cuisine - 
                showcasing so many different dips and flavors. The salatim spread was an exciting start‚Äîsoft pita with a vibrant, colorful 
                assortment of veggies, sauces, tastes, and textures. The shawarma-spiced cauliflower stole the show, roasted to perfection 
                with just the right blend of spices. To top it off, the brown sugar-vanilla soft serve with blueberry compote was the perfect 
                sweet finish‚Äîcreamy and indulgent with a fruity twist. The lively, communal atmosphere adds to the fun, making it a great spot 
                for group dining. It's a place where every dish leaves an impression.

            <p>
                Overall review: Pera offers a refreshing and modern take on Mediterranean cuisine. The watermelon and heirloom tomato salad was a 
                bright and refreshing start, with the sweetness of the watermelon perfectly balancing the tangy tomatoes. The crushed walnut and 
                spicy pepper "muammara" was rich and bold, with a delightful blend of textures and a hint of heat that made it stand out. The 
                restaurant's sleek, contemporary vibe adds to the overall experience, making it a great spot for a casual yet refined meal. 
                Each dish felt thoughtfully prepared, creating a satisfying dining experience.
